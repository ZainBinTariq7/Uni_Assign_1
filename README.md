Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment
Overview
This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python. The objective is to explore relationships within a dataset, perform various statistical analyses, and visualize key insights using matplotlib and seaborn. The results will be presented in a PDF report alongside the code in this repository.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about companies, including their revenues, countries, and other relevant attributes.

Objectives
The assignment focuses on:

Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
Visualizing distributions and comparisons using bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
Demonstrating proficiency with data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis.
Visualization Details
Top 10 Companies by Revenue: A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 companies ranked by revenue.
Country Distribution: A pie chart visualizing the distribution of companies by country.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap to identify correlations between numeric features in the dataset.
Getting Started
These instructions will guide you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following requirements and tools installed:

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
Install the necessary libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Installing
A step-by-step guide to set up the development environment:

Clone the repository.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file Assign_1.ipynb in an environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
Repeat these steps as needed until you have set up the environment successfully.

Running the Tests
Sample Tests
This section includes tests that confirm the data loading and transformation work as expected. Additional tests verify that the visualizations are rendered correctly.

Style Test: Checks if best practices and coding style guidelines have been followed.
Deployment
Additional steps and notes for deploying the analysis or visualizations on a live system can be added here.
