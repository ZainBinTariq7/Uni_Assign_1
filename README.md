<h1> Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment </h1> <br>
<h2>Overview</h2> <br>

This project involves data analysis and visualization using Python. The objective is to explore relationships within a dataset, perform various statistical analyses, and visualize key insights using matplotlib and seaborn. The results will be presented in a PDF report alongside the code in this repository.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about companies, including their revenues, countries, and other relevant attributes.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
The assignment focuses on:

Analyzing the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
Visualizing distributions and comparisons using bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps.
Demonstrating proficiency with data manipulation, cleaning, and statistical analysis. <br>

<h2>Visualization Details</h2> <br>

<strong>Top 10 Companies by Revenue:</strong> A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 companies ranked by revenue.
<strong>Country Distribution:</strong> A pie chart visualizing the distribution of companies by country.
<strong>Correlation Heatmap:</strong> A heatmap to identify correlations between numeric features in the dataset.

<h2>Getting Started</h2> <br>

These instructions will guide you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. <br>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2> <br>
Ensure you have the following requirements and tools installed:

<b>Python 3.x</b>
<b>Libraries:</b> pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
Install the necessary libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy <br>
<h2>Installing</h2> <br>
A step-by-step guide to set up the development environment:

<b>Clone the repository</b>. <br>
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file Assign_1.ipynb in an environment that supports Jupyter notebooks. <br>
Repeat these steps as needed until you have set up the environment successfully.
